For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n","\n","One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n","\n","### Improving confidence\n","\n","One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n","\n","\n","## Learn more\n","\n","To learn more about evaluation systems, check out [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/enhancing-llm-quality-and-interpretability-with-the-vertex-gen-ai-evaluation-service?e=48754805) focusing on evaluation using Google Cloud's Gen AI Evaluation Service.\n","\n","And be sure to read the **bonus whitepaper** on [Evaluating Large Language Models](https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/neurips_evaluation.pdf).\n","\n","*- [Mark McD](https://linktr.ee/markmcd)*"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e7cb04b9","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.010213,"end_time":"2025-04-03T05:52:36.860373","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-03T05:52:36.85016","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"9cb7ea0e","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.009478,"end_time":"2025-04-03T05:52:36.879928","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-03T05:52:36.87045","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"toc_visible":true},"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30918,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":170.979323,"end_time":"2025-04-03T05:52:37.612853","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2025-04-03T05:49:46.63353","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
