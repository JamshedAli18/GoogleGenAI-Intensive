# GoogleGenAI-Intensive

Welcome to the repository for the *5-Day Generative AI Intensive*, an online workshop designed by Googleâ€™s ML researchers and engineers. This program, dives deep into the technologies and techniques behind Generative AI, blending conceptual learning with hands-on coding.

## Course Overview
- **Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering**  
  Evolution of LLMs, transformers, fine-tuning, inference acceleration, and prompt engineering techniques.
- **Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases**  
  Understanding embeddings, vector search algorithms, and their applications with LLMs.
- **Generative AI Agents**  
  Building AI agents with a focus on core components and iterative development.
- **Domain-Specific LLMs**  
  Exploring specialized LLMs (e.g., SecLM, Med-PaLM) with insights from their creators.
- **MLOps for Generative AI**  
  Adapting MLOps for Gen AI and using Vertex AI tools for foundation models.
